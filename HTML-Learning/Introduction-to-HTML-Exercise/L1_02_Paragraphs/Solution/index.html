    <h1>Principles For Clean HTML Code</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>Beautiful and clean HTML</strong> is the foundation of a beautiful
      website. When I teach people about CSS, I always begin by telling them
      that good CSS can only exist with equally good HTML markup. A house is
      only as strong as its foundation, right? The advantages of
      <strong>clean, semantic HTML</strong> are many, yet so many websites
      suffer from poorly written markup.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Strict DOCTYPE</strong>. If we are going to do this, letâ€™s just do
      it right. No need for a discussion about whether to use
      <em>HTML 4.01</em> or <em>XHTML</em>
      1.0: both of them offer a strict version that will keep us nice and honest
      as we write our code.
